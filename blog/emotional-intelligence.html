      <h2 class="text-blue">1. Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        There have been severals debate about IQ and EQ, which one is more
        important. Lets first get to know what they represent and why they are
        important in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow"
          >The term 'IQ' was coined in 1912 by the psychologist William Stern in
          relation to the German term Intelligenzquotient. It is a number used
          to express a person's overall mental ability.
        </span>
        IQ was represented as a ratio of mental age to chronological age x 100.
        A child with a mental age of 15 and a chronological age of 10 would have
        an IQ of 150. IQ represents ability such as:
        <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
          <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
          <li>Fluid Reasoning</li>
          <li>Working and short-term memory</li>
          <li>and so on...</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow">Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient 
          or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive 
          ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, 
          overcome challenges and defuse conflict.
        </span>
        EQ is commonly difined by:
        <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
          <li>Self-management</li>
          <li>Self-awareness</li>
          <li>Social awareness</li>
          <li>Relationship management</li>  
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <h2 class="text-blue">2. How are they different </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow">Both kinds of intelligence can influence 
        your job performance, relationships, and overall well-being.
        </span>
        <span class="text-green">IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, 
          and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize 
          emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
        </span>
        </p>
      <p>
        IQ tests can measure language, processing, memory, and reasoning. Your score tends 
        to remain consistent from childhood to adulthood. It’s a test of intelligence, something 
        you’re largely born with. It’s not a test of knowledge, which represents what you learn 
        through education or life experience. IQ is still recognized as an important element of 
        success, particularly when it comes to academic achievement. People with high IQs typically 
        to do well in school, often earn more money, and tend to be healthier in general.
      </p>  
      <p>
        However, as we know, it's not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most 
        fulfilled in life. IQ is not enough on its own to achieve success in life. For instance, 
        within the tech sector, research shows 6 factors that distinguish top performers from average 
        performers, and 4 of which refers to EQ not IQ. EQ affects your performance at school or work, 
        your physical and mental health, your relationships,etc. Your IQ can help you pass tests at school, 
        or get through those questions in a test-based interview, but it is your EQ that helps you manage 
        the stress, the emotions, the relationships with your friends or co-workers. Eventually, IQ and EQ 
        are most effective when they build off one another.

        <h2 class="text-blue">3. Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          <cite class="text-green">"Emotional intelligence is the ability to sense, understand, and effectively apply the 
          power and acumen of emotions as a source of human energy, information, connection, and 
          influence."</cite> - Robert K. Cooper
        </p>
        <p>
          Research has shown that people with high EQ are more likely to get hired, promoted and therefore have better 
          salaries than those with higher IQ but low EQ. <span class="text-yellow" style="padding-left:1em;">Why?</span> 
          <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
            <li>A high EQ help you to build relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflicts, hence
              improve job satisfaction. Eventually when it come to recruiting or promoting people to management 
              roles (which usually comes with better salaries/benefits), employers look for <span class="text-green">high EQ</span> rather than 
              <span class="text-green">high IQ</span> people.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text-yellow">Self-awareness and self-management</span>: the ability to 
            regconise one's emitions, strengths, weaknesses, motivations, then has the ability to regulate self-emotions. 
            With high EQ, one is able to control their emotions instead of letting them control you.
            </li>
            <li><span class="text-green">Empathy, motivation and relationship management</span>: emotionally connecting 
              with other and take into account their point of views (including one's self) giving you the ability to 
              motivate and get motivated, therefore being able to build a genuine relationship within yourself and with 
              others. This would improve your leadership skills, leading you to success not only in working but also in most 
              aspects in real life.
            </li>
          </ul>
          The debate whether IQ or IQ is more important has been going on for centuries. At some points in time, IQ was 
          viewed as the primary determinant of success, accomplishment and achievements. However, it is not the only determinant 
          in life success. Emotional abilities can also influence consumer's choices when confronted with buying decisions. 
          Nobel-prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman found that
          <cite class="text-green"> people would rather deal with a 
            person they trust and like than someone they do not, 
            even if that means paying more for an inferior product.
