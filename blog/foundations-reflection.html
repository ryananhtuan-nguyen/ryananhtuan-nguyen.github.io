        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Due to the core learning, I've learnt that my mindset could be changed.
        Its not as hard and impossible as I thought it would be. Secondly I've
        learnt how to notice my emotions and somewhat have the control over
        them. Last but not least I realized I am able to focus on studying
        without being distracted too much by other things.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-yellow">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values, empathy and self-awareness play a very important role in
        learning and programming. First of all, they help you regconize your
        strengths and weaknesses, and from there you will be able to adjust
        yourself in order to achieve your goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your self identity values are fundamental principles that shape
        <span class="text-pink">your</span> ethical behavious, responsible
        coding practices, and a strong sense of integrity. Self-awareness is to
        have a deep understanding of
        <span class="text-pink">your</span> thoughts, emotions, strengths,
        weaknesses, motivations, etc. Empathy, on the other hand, is the ability
        to understand and share the feelings & perspectives of
        <span class="text-pink">others</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, they give you the ability of learning and growth as you could
        now see yourself clearer. You could be able to manage challenges, stress
        and your own emotions, hence being able to seek continuous learning
        opportunities, stay open to feedback, and adapt to new technologies.
        More importantly, your teamwork skills will be greatly enhanced.
      </p>

        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would say neuroplasticity and growth mindset supprised me the most. Im
        familiar to these concepts, but have never really been able to see the
        changes in myself when I am trying to apply the pratices before.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-yellow">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the most challenging aspects of the core learning are
        trying to change your mindset, being able to notice and control your
        emotions, and being able to avoid distractions.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-yellow">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because this course is for anyone who would like to get a foot in the
        tech-industry. Regardless of experiences, skills, knowledges beforehand,
        everyone that go through the course would have a deep understanding and
        the ability to work as a developer. It is a very challenging and
        complicated field, specially for beginners or whoever not having any
        relative understandings about it. Core learning is a very important part
        that prepare people with the ability to adapt, control, overcome all
        these incoming challenges.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-yellow">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The time I spent studying core learning here does not feel like a waste
        of time. However, in my opinion, it might be a bit too much. As this is
        a very hard, short, and intense course about a very complicated field,
        people coming into the course are expected to be very mentally
        well-prepared.
