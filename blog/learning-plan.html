        1. Long term goal or career pathway
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        My long term goal is to become a software developer. Eventually I want
        to have my own tech company that provides software to solve
        <span class="text-pink">real world</span>
        problems.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left" class="text-blue">
        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        I am a slow learner which take longer time than others to learn new
        things and get used to them. However once I learnt and practiced enough
        they would be permanent. I am used to working under pressure and love
        learning new things so wouldn’t be a problem when it comes to learning.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left" class="text-blue">
        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        I would love to see my ability working as a team member developed while
        at Dev Academy. Also gradually changing my mindset to think as a
        developer and improving my problem-solving skills, not only technical
        but also real-life problems.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left" class="text-blue">
        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        Currently I am not working at all, dedicating all my time into this
        programme and treat it as a full-time job. I have my discord app open
        all the time while Im doing the work, to be able to support and receive
        supports from other learners, or facilitators if needed.
        <br />
        When things are building up and starting to get to me I seek help
        immediately either from other learners, my home-group people or any
        available facilitator. I do not hesitate to ask questions if I don’t
        understand, even when I feel like that might be a very simple question.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left" class="text-blue">
        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p class="text-align:left;">
        I am doing my work according to the Dev Academy curriculum. If I get
        stuck at some point I will seek help straight away until I am able to
        understand and finish the task, then move on to the next one. I am not
        letting things building up for a long period of time and eventually it
        would cost more time to fix it than confront it right from the
        beginning.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left" class="text-blue">
        6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        I expect the facilitation team to be understanding and supportive. So
        far every time I had a technical question I received response quite fast
        from one of the facilitators in the group chat. I also look forward to
        be shared the experiences on how to land a decent job in the industry
        when I finish this programme as well.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left" class="text-blue">
        7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
        I am currently living with my partner and she is working full time. My
        family is still in my home country and I don’t have any kids (yet) so
        there is pretty much no commitments to other things for me at the
        moment. I am able to dedicate all my time on the programme, and even
        extra time if needed to complete required tasks that help my learning
        grow.
