    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

      <h2 class="text-blue">1. A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        Last sprint, I started learning javascript and got introduced to a lot
        of new concepts. One of which was how to use the loops and conditional
        statements. And that means there is a whole lot of syntaxes to get
        familiar to. For the <span class="text-green">if else statements</span>,
        the syntax was:
      </p>
      <pre class="text-white">
    if(something) {
      do something
    } else {
      do something else
    }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The task was pretty easy at the time, just use the
        <span class="text-green">if else statements</span>
        to check if a variable is less than something then log a specific
        sentence to the console. However, I was missing the
        <span class="text-green">( )</span> for the condition, so the code did
        not run as expected. I then went to the console to see what was the
        error message, but again, at the time things werent quite clear to me
        and I had no idea what the error was. If I was missing something on the
        syntax I expected the error message to be "missing something somewhere"
        but it was not it. I tried to change something in the code above, and
        then in the code below, nothing worked out. I then tried to google the
        error message but there werent actually anything helpful. Then I tried
        to look up the code line by line still didnt realize it. It was really
        frustrated throughout the process of trying to find what the problem
        was. I ended up deleting the whole thing and started from the beginning
        again. That is when I realize what I missed and fixed the problem. One
        thing I've learnt through this process is when you learn something,
        always try it out first. Do some examples, run it through a couple of
        very simple things until you get how it really works, then start working
        with it when you fully understand it.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-blue">2. A time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p>
        Last sprint I worked with the Javascript-cafe. The exercise was
        <q
          >I want a feature where every product has a wholesaleCost property,
          and each product has a Restock button next to it. Clicking the restock
          button adds one more of that product to your stock, and subtracts the
          wholesaleCost from your cash. If you don't have enough cash, an alert
          pops up telling you that you can't restock.
        </q>
      </p>
      <p>First of all, I broke it down to smaller tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding wholesaleCost property</li>
        <li>Adding Restock buttons next to each products</li>
        <li>Modify the restock button as required</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Going through this process, I needed to break down the last task
        further:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating the function Restock() that adds 1 more to the stock, then
          subtracts wholesaleCost from cash. If not enough cash, pop up an alert
        </li>
        <li>Match the Restock function to the button</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then, I used pseudo code to draft what I would need to make a proper
        Restock function.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a fun process to go through, however I think it requires a lot of
        patience and focus. I've learnt that it is much more easier to break
        things down into smaller chunks, solving them one by one and then join
        them together so we could solve the bigger problem.

        3. Reflect on how confident you feel using these problem-solving
        techniques/processes
      </h2>
      <p>
        So far, Im pretty confident with using these problem-solving techniques.
        However I need to improve my pseudo code as sometimes I think it was too
        detailed and sometimes it was not detailed enough so it was hard to
        understand what I mean even to myself.
      </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-blue">
      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h2>
    <p>I was never reluctant to ask for help. Whenever I ran into a problem, I try my best 
      googling/researching/trying somethings and if none worked out I immidiately reach out for help in 
      the group chat.
